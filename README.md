# Gem::SpecificInstall

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'specific_install'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install specific_install

## Usage

A Rubygem plugin that allows you to install an "edge" gem straight from its github repository, 
  or install one from an arbitrary url web:

ex:

`
  $ gem specific_install https://github.com/githubsvnclone/rdoc.git
`

Or more explicitly:

`
  $ gem specific_install -l http://github.com/githubsvnclone/rdoc.git
`

Or very tersely:

`gem specific_install githubsvnclone/rdoc`

Or a specific branch

`
  $ gem specific_install http://github.com/githubsvnclone/rdoc.git edge
`

Or a specific branch in an explicit way

`
  $ gem specific_install -l http://github.com/githubsvnclone/rdoc.git -b edge
`

The following URI types are accepted:

- http(s)://github.com/rdp/specific_install.git
- http(s)://github.com/rdp/specific_install-current.gem

### Additional Options

    -l --location URL of resource 
      Formats of URL/Resource
        * Full URL to HTTP Repo `https://github.com/rdp/specific_install.git`
        * Full URL to Git Repo  `git@github.com:rdp/specific_install.git`
        * URL of Pre-Built Gem  `http://example.com/specific_install.gem`
        * Github Repo shortcode `rdp/specific_install`

    -b --branch BRANCH to use for Gem creation
      Branch option does a `git checkout BRANCH` before `gem build GEM`
      Example:
          `git specific_install -l rdp/specific_install -b pre-release`
      Note: This feature is new and may not fail gracefully.


    `git_install` is aliased to the behavior of `specific_install`
      This alias is shorter and is more intention revealing of the gem's behavior.
## Internal Behavior

It runs `git clone`, and `rake install,` install the gem, then deletes the temp directory]
